  <div class="i6"> &nbsp;<span class="smcapa">HEN</span> fleets of yachts were sailing round</div>
  <div class="i7">The rippling bay and ruffled sound,</div>
  <div class="i7">And steering out where Neptune raves,</div>
  <div class="i7">To try their speed in rougher waves,</div>
  <div class="i7">The Brownies from a lofty place</div>
  <div class="i7">Looked out upon the novel race.</div>
  <div class="i7">Said one: "A race is under way.</div>
  <div class="i7">They'll start from somewhere in the bay,</div>
  <div class="i7">To leave the frowning forts behind,</div>
  <div class="i7">And Jersey headlands, as you'll find,</div>
  <div class="i7">And sail around, as I surmise,</div>
  <div class="i7">The light-ship that at anchor lies.</div>
  <div class="i7">All sails are spread, the masts will bend,</div>
  <div class="i7">For some rich prize they now contend&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i7">A golden cup or goblet fine,</div>
  <div class="i7">Or punch-bowl of antique design."</div>
  <div class="i7">Another said: "To-night, when all</div>
  <div class="i7">Have left the boats, we'll make a call,</div>
  <div class="i7">And boldly sail a yacht or two</div>
  <div class="i7">Around that ship, as people do.</div>

  <div class="i7">If I can read the signs aright</div>
  <div class="i7">That nature shows 'twill be a night</div>

  <div class="i7">So thus they talked, and plans they laid,</div>
  <div class="i7">And waited for the evening shade.</div>
  <div class="i7">And when the lamps in city square</div>
  <div class="i7">And narrow street began to glare,</div>
  <div class="i7">The Brownies ventured from their place</div>
  <div class="i7">To find the yachts and sail their race.</div>
  <div class="i7">In equal numbers now the band,</div>
  <div class="i7">Divided up, the vessels manned.</div>
  <div class="i7">Short time they wasted in debate</div>
  <div class="i7">Who should be captain, cook, or mate;</div>
  <div class="i7">But it was settled at the start</div>
  <div class="i7">That all would take an active part,</div>
  <div class="i7">And be prepared to pull and haul</div>
  <div class="i7">If trouble came in shape of squall.</div>
  <div class="i7">For in the cunning Brownie crowd</div>
  <div class="i7">No domineering is allowed;</div>
  <div class="i7">All stand alike with equal power,</div>
  <div class="i7">And friendly feeling rules the hour.</div>
  <div class="i7">The Brownies' prophecy was true.</div>
  <div class="i7">That night the wind increased and blew,</div>
  <div class="i7">And dipped the sails into the wave,</div>
  <div class="i7">And work to every Brownie gave;</div>
<span class="figpoeml">
<img src="images/i019b.jpg" width="150" height="125" alt="" class="alignleft" />
</span>
  <div class="i10">Not one on board but had to clew,</div>
  <div class="i10">Or reef, or steer, or something do.</div>
  <div class="i10">Sometimes the yachts ran side by side</div>
  <div class="i10">A mile or more, then parted wide,</div>
  <div class="i10">Still tacking round and shifting sail</div>
  <div class="i10">To take advantage of the gale.</div>

  <div class="i0">Had hooks that seemed a charm to bear,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">And fish of various scale and fin</div>

  <div class="i8">From such a maw to win the hook.</div>
  <div class="i8">With horns that pointed every way,</div>
  <div class="i8">And life that seemed to stick and stay,</div>
  <div class="i8">Like antlered stag that stands at bay,</div>
  <div class="i8">He lay and eyed the Brownie band,</div>

  <div class="i8">The gamy bass, when playing fine,</div>
  <div class="i8">Oft tried the strength of hook and line,</div>
  <div class="i8">And strove an hour before his mind</div>
  <div class="i8">To changing quarters was resigned.</div>
  <div class="i8">Some eels proved more than even match</div>
  <div class="i8">For those who made the wondrous catch,</div>
  <div class="i8">And, like a fortune won with ease,</div>
  <div class="i8">They slipped through fingers by degrees,</div>
  <div class="i8">And bade good-bye to margin sands,</div>
  <div class="i8">In spite of half a dozen hands.</div>
  <div class="i8">The hungry, wakeful birds of air</div>
  <div class="i8">Soon gathered 'round to claim their share,</div>
  <div class="i8">And did for days themselves regale</div>

  <div class="i2">While more escaped with wounded gill,</div>
  <div class="i2">And yards of line they're trailing still;</div>

  <div class="i10">That seemed in need of proper care.</div>
  <div class="i10">Said one, "Neglected ground like this</div>

  <div class="i13">For those who ran for seed-supplies.</div>
  <div class="i13">But, when they came, one had his say,</div>

  <div class="i9">And ere he had his bearings got,</div>
  <div class="i9">The rogue was half across the lot."</div>
  <div class="i0">Then seed was sown in various styles,</div>
  <div class="i0">In circles, squares, and single files;</div>
  <div class="i0">While here and there, in central parts,</div>
  <div class="i0">They fashioned diamonds, stars, and hearts,</div>
  <div class="i0">Some using rake, some plying hoe,</div>

  <div class="i9">And to the soil their hands applied.</div>
  <div class="i9">To stakes and racks more were assigned,</div>
  <div class="i9">That climbing-vines support might find.</div>

  <div class="i7">Had less attraction for his eyes</div>
  <div class="i7">Than had the shining candy-balls</div>
  <div class="i7">For Brownies, swarming through his halls.</div>
  <div class="i7">Soon coal was from the cellar brought</div>

  <div class="i7">And syrup sweet, in cans of tin.</div>

  <div class="i12">That dancing-masters never taught,</div>
  <div class="i12">And smothered cries and swinging hand</div>
  <div class="i12">Would wake the wonder of the band.</div>
  <div class="i12">And when the candy boiled until</div>

  <div class="i12">Take every shape or twist, and seem</div>

  <div class="i7">And had but little time to spare.</div>
  <div class="i7">The shortest way, as often found,</div>
  <div class="i7">Was o'er the roughest piece of ground,</div>
  <div class="i7">Where rocks as large as houses lay</div>
  <div class="i7">All scattered round in wild array.</div>
  <div class="i7">Some covered o'er with clinging vines,</div>
  <div class="i7">Some bearing up gigantic pines,</div>

  <div class="i6"> &nbsp;<span class="smcapa">WHILE</span> Brownies strayed along a pier</div>
  <div class="i7">To view the shipping lying near,</div>
  <div class="i7">A tugboat drew their gaze at last;</div>
  <div class="i7">'Twas at a neighboring wharf made fast.</div>
  <div class="i7">Cried one: "See what in black and red</div>
  <div class="i7">Below the pilot-house is spread!</div>
  <div class="i7">In honor of the Brownie Band,</div>
  <div class="i7">It bears our name in letters grand.</div>
  <div class="i7">Through all the day she's on the go;</div>
  <div class="i7">Now with a laden scow in tow,</div>
  <div class="i7">And next with barges two or three,</div>
  <div class="i7">Then taking out a ship to sea,</div>
  <div class="i7">Or through the Narrows steaming round</div>
  <div class="i7">In search of vessels homeward bound;</div>
  <div class="i7">She's stanch and true from stack to keel,</div>
  <div class="i7">And we should highly honored feel."</div>
  <div class="i7">Another said: "An hour ago,</div>
  <div class="i7">The men went up to see a show,</div>
  <div class="i7">And left the tugboat lying here.</div>
  <div class="i7">The steam is up, our course is clear,</div>
  <div class="i7">We'll crowd on board without delay</div>
  <div class="i7">And run her up and down the bay.</div>
  <div class="i7">We have indeed a special claim,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
  <div class="i7">Because she bears the 'Brownie' name.</div>
  <div class="i7">Before the dawn creeps through the east</div>
  <div class="i7">We'll know about her speed at least,</div>
  <div class="i7">And prove how such a craft behaves</div>
  <div class="i7">When cutting through the roughest waves.</div>
  <div class="i7">Behind the wheel I'll take my stand</div>
  <div class="i7">And steer her round with skillful hand,</div>
  <div class="i7">Now down the river, now around</div>
  <div class="i7">The bay, or up the broader sound;</div>
  <div class="i7">Throughout the trip I'll keep her clear</div>
  <div class="i7">Of all that might awaken fear.</div>
  <div class="i7">When hard-a-port the helm I bring,</div>
  <div class="i7">Or starboard make a sudden swing,</div>
  <div class="i7">The Band can rest as free from dread</div>
  <div class="i7">As if they slept on mossy bed.</div>
  <div class="i7">I something know about the seas,</div>
  <div class="i7">I've boxed a compass, if you please,</div>
  <div class="i7">And so can steer her east or west,</div>
  <div class="i7">Or north or south, as suits me best.</div>
  <div class="i7">Without the aid of twinkling stars</div>
  <div class="i7">Or light-house lamps, I'll cross the bars.</div>
  <div class="i7">I know when north winds nip the nose,</div>
  <div class="i7">Or sou'-sou'-west the 'pig-wind' blows,</div>
  <div class="i7">As hardy sailors call the gale</div>
  <div class="i7">That from that quarter strikes the sail."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i7">A third replied: "No doubt you're smart</div>
  <div class="i7">And understand the pilot's art,</div>
  <div class="i7">But more than one a hand should take,</div>
  <div class="i7">For all our lives will be at stake.</div>

  <div class="i7">In spite of eyes and ears and hands,</div>
  <div class="i7">And all the skill a crew commands,</div>
  <div class="i7">How oft collisions crush the keel</div>
  <div class="i7">And give the fish a sumptuous meal!</div>
  <div class="i7">Too many rocks around the bay</div>
  <div class="i7">Stick up their heads to bar the way.</div>
  <div class="i7">Too many vessels, long and wide,</div>
  <div class="i7">At anchor in the channel ride</div>
  <div class="i7">For us to show ourselves unwise</div>
  <div class="i7">And trust to but one pair of eyes."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i7">Ere long the tugboat swinging clear</div>
  <div class="i7">Turned bow to stream and left the pier,</div>
  <div class="i7">While many Brownies, young and old,</div>
  <div class="i7">From upper deck to lower hold</div>
  <div class="i7">Were crowding round in happy vein</div>
  <div class="i7">Still striving better views to gain.</div>
  <div class="i7">Some watched the waves around them roll;</div>
  <div class="i7">Some stayed below to shovel coal,</div>
<img src="images/i094.jpg" width="485" height="132" alt="" class="aligncenter" />
  <div class="i7">From hand to hand, with pitches strong,</div>

</span>
  <div class="i7">In spite of all their care and skill,</div>
  <div class="i7">While running straight or turning round</div>
  <div class="i7">In river, bay, or broader sound,</div>
  <div class="i7">At times they ran upon a rock,</div>
  <div class="i7">And startled by the sudden shock</div>
  <div class="i7">Some timid Brownies, turning pale,</div>
  <div class="i7">Would spring at once across the rail;</div>
  <div class="i7">And then, repenting, find all hope</div>
  <div class="i7">Of life depended on a rope,</div>
  <div class="i7">That willing hands were quick to throw</div>
  <div class="i7">And hoist them from the waves below.</div>
  <div class="i7">Sometimes too near a ship they ran</div>
  <div class="i7">For peace of mind; again, their plan</div>
  <div class="i7">Would come to naught through lengthy tow</div>
  <div class="i7">Of barges passing to and fro.</div>
  <div class="i7">The painted buoys around the bay</div>
  <div class="i7">At times occasioned some dismay&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i7">They took them for torpedoes dread</div>
  <div class="i7">That might the boat in fragments spread,</div>
  <div class="i7">Awake the city's slumbering crowds,</div>
  <div class="i7">And hoist the band among the clouds.</div>
  <div class="i7">But thus, till hints of dawn appeared</div>
  <div class="i7">Now here, now there, the boat was steered</div>
  <div class="i7">With many joys and many fears,</div>
  <div class="i7">That some will bear in mind for years;</div>
  <div class="i7">But at her pier once more she lay</div>
  <div class="i7">When night gave place to creeping day.</div>

  <div class="i6a"> &nbsp;<span class="smcapa">NE</span> night the Brownies stood beside</div>
  <div class="i7">A long canal, whose silent tide</div>
  <div class="i7">Connected seaboard cities great</div>
  <div class="i7">With inland sections of the state.</div>
  <div class="i7">The laden boats, so large and strong,</div>
  <div class="i7">Were tied to trees by hawsers long;</div>
  <div class="i7">No boatmen stood by helm or oar,</div>
  <div class="i7">No mules were tugging on the shore;</div>
  <div class="i7">All work on land and water too</div>
  <div class="i7">Had been abandoned by the crew.</div>
  <div class="i7">Said one: "We see, without a doubt,</div>
  <div class="i7">What some dispute has brought about.</div>
  <div class="i7">Perhaps a strike for greater pay,</div>
  <div class="i7">For even rates, or shorter day,</div>
  <div class="i7">Has caused the boats to loiter here</div>
  <div class="i7">With cargoes costing some one dear.</div>
  <div class="i7">These cabbages so large and round</div>
  <div class="i7">Should, long ere this, the dish have found,</div>
  <div class="i7">Upon some kitchen-stove or range</div>
  <div class="i7">To spread an odor rich and strange;</div>
  <div class="i7">Those squashes, too, should not be lost</div>
  <div class="i7">By long exposure to the frost,</div>
  <div class="i7">When they would prove so great a prize</div>
  <div class="i7">To old and young, if baked in pies.</div>
  <div class="i7">And then those pippins, ripe and fair,</div>
  <div class="i7">From some fine orchard picked with care,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
  <div class="i7">Should not to rot and ruin go,</div>
  <div class="i7">Though work is hard or wages low,</div>
  <div class="i7">When thousands would be glad to stew</div>
  <div class="i7">The smallest apples there in view."</div>

  <div class="i7">Another said: "We lack the might</div>
  <div class="i7">To set the wrongs of labor right,</div>
  <div class="i7">But by the power within us placed</div>
  <div class="i7">We'll see that nothing goes to waste.</div>
  <div class="i7">So every hand must be applied</div>
  <div class="i7">That boats upon their way may glide."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i7">Then some ran here and there with speed</div>
  <div class="i7">To find a team to suit their need.</div>
  <div class="i7">A pair of mules, that grazed about</div>
  <div class="i7">The grassy banks, were fitted out</div>
<span class="figpoeml">
<img src="images/i130a.jpg" width="200" height="89" alt="" class="alignleft" />
</span>
  <div class="i13">With straps and ropes without delay</div>
  <div class="i13">To start the boats upon their way;</div>
  <div class="i13">And next some straying goats were found,</div>
  <div class="i13">Where in a yard they nibbled round</div>
  <div class="i13">Destroying plants of rarest kind</div>
  <div class="i13">That owners in the town could find.</div>
  <div class="i7">Soon, taken from their rich repast,</div>
  <div class="i7">They found themselves in harness fast;</div>
  <div class="i7">Then into active service pressed</div>
  <div class="i7">They trod the tow-path with the rest.</div>
<img src="images/i130b.jpg" width="480" height="128" alt="" class="aligncenter" />
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">On deck some Brownies took their stand</div>
  <div class="i0">To man the helm, or give command,</div>
  <div class="i0">And oversee the work; while more</div>
  <div class="i0">Stayed with the teams upon the shore.</div>
<img src="images/i131.jpg" width="400" height="487" alt="" class="aligncenter" />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
  <div class="i4">At times the rope would drag along</div>
  <div class="i4">And catch on snags or branches long,</div>
<span class="figpoeml">
<img src="images/i132a.jpg" width="204" height="86" alt="" class="alignleft" />
</span>
  <div class="i12a">And cause delays they ill could bear,</div>
  <div class="i12a">For little time they had to spare.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i12a">With accidents they often met,</div>
  <div class="i12a">And some were bruised and more were wet;</div>
  <div class="i12a">Some tumbled headlong down the hold;</div>
  <div class="i12a">And some from heaping cargoes rolled.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i4">But what care Brownies for a bruise,</div>
  <div class="i4">Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,</div>
  <div class="i4">When enterprises bold and new</div>
<span class="figpoemr">
<img src="images/i132b.jpg" width="121" height="288" alt="" class="alignright" />
</span>
  <div class="i0">Must ere the dawn be carried through?</div>
  <div class="i0">If half the band were drenched, no doubt</div>
  <div class="i0">The work would still be carried out,</div>
  <div class="i0">For extra strength would then be found</div>
  <div class="i0">In those who still were safe and sound.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">But once, when "low bridge!" was the shout</div>
  <div class="i0">They stood and stared or ran about</div>
  <div class="i0">Till in the water, heels o'er head,</div>
  <div class="i0">Some members of the band were spread.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">A few could swim, and held their own;</div>
  <div class="i0">But more went downward like a stone</div>
  <div class="i0">Until, without the plummet's aid,</div>
  <div class="i4">They learned how deep canals are made.</div>
  <div class="i4">In spite of all the kicks and flings</div>
  <div class="i4">That fright at such a moment brings,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
  <div class="i4">Through lack of art, or weight of fear,</div>
  <div class="i4">It looked as if their end was near.</div>
  <div class="i4">The order now to stop the team</div>
  <div class="i4">Would pass along with sign and scream,</div>
  <div class="i4">And those on land would know by this</div>
  <div class="i4">That something startling was amiss;</div>
<img src="images/i133.jpg" width="460" height="441" alt="" class="aligncenter" />
  <div class="i4">And those on board could plainly see</div>
  <div class="i4">Unless assistance there could be,</div>
  <div class="i4">In shape of ropes and fingers strong,</div>
  <div class="i4">There'd be some vacancies, ere long!</div>

<img src="images/i134.jpg" width="467" height="550" alt="" class="aligncenter" />
  <div class="i4">By chance a net was to be had,</div>
  <div class="i4">That boatmen used for catching shad&mdash;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
  <div class="i4">A gill-net of the strongest kind,</div>
  <div class="i4">For heavy catches well designed;</div>
  <div class="i4">Few shad against its meshes ran</div>
  <div class="i4">But left their bones on some one's pan,</div>
  <div class="i4">This bulky thing the active crew</div>
  <div class="i4">Far overboard with promptness threw.</div>
  <div class="i4">A hold at once some Brownies found,</div>
  <div class="i4">While others in its folds were bound,</div>
  <div class="i4">Until like fish in great dismay</div>
  <div class="i4">Inside the net they struggling lay.</div>
  <div class="i4">But willing hands were overhead,</div>
  <div class="i4">And quickly from the muddy bed</div>
  <div class="i4">Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled</div>
  <div class="i4">The dripping net was upward hauled,</div>
  <div class="i4">With all the Brownies clinging fast,</div>
  <div class="i4">Till safe on deck they stood at last.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i10">Sometimes a mule fell off the road</div>
  <div class="i10">And in the stream with all its load.</div>

  <div class="i4 clear">Then precious time would be consumed</div>
  <div class="i4">Before the trip could be resumed.</div>
  <div class="i4">Thus on they went from mile to mile,</div>
  <div class="i4">With many strange mishaps the while,</div>
  <div class="i4">But working bravely through the night</div>
  <div class="i4">Until the city came in sight.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i4">Said one: "Now, thanks to bearded goats</div>
  <div class="i4">And patient mules, the heavy boats</div>
  <div class="i4">For hours have glided on their way,</div>
  <div class="i4">And reached the waters of the bay.</div>
  <div class="i4">But see, the sun's about to show</div>
  <div class="i4">His colors to the world below,</div>
  <div class="i4">And other birds than those of night</div>
  <div class="i4">Begin to take their morning flight.</div>
  <div class="i4">Our time is up; we've done our best;</div>
  <div class="i4">The ebbing tide must do the rest;</div>
  <div class="i4">Now drifting downward to their pier</div>
  <div class="i4">Let barges unassisted steer,</div>
  <div class="i4">While we make haste, with nimble feet,</div>
  <div class="i4">To find in woods a safe retreat."</div>

  <div class="i7">T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> Brownies once approached in glee</div>
  <div class="i7">A slumbering city by the sea.</div>
  <div class="i7">"In yonder town," the leader cried,</div>
  <div class="i7">"I hear the artist does reside</div>
  <div class="i7">Who pictures out, with patient hand,</div>
  <div class="i7">The doings of the Brownie band."</div>
  <div class="i7">"I'd freely give," another said,</div>
  <div class="i7">"The cap that now protects my head,</div>
  <div class="i7">To find the room, where, day by day,</div>
  <div class="i7">He shows us at our work or play."</div>
  <div class="i7">A third replied: "Your cap retain</div>
  <div class="i7">To shield your poll from snow or rain.</div>
  <div class="i7">His studio is farther down,</div>
  <div class="i7">Within a corner-building brown.</div>
  <div class="i7">So follow me a mile or more</div>
  <div class="i7">And soon we'll reach the office door."</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
  <div class="i7">Then through the park, around the square,</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
  <div class="i7">The anxious Brownies quickly passed,</div>

<img src="images/i139.jpg" width="375" height="450" alt="" class="aligncenter" />
  <div class="i7">They paused awhile to view the sight,</div>

  <div class="i7">For now they gaze upon a scene</div>

  <div class="i7">To help some farmer in his need.</div>
  <div class="i7">Said one, "Upon this desk, no doubt,</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i5">A telephone gave great delight</div>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
